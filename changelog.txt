Lifestyle and culture is vacant and can be populated using the sort options

Sort Options:
Channels outside the range 100-999 can now be used

Five extra user bouquets added. The sample sort 3 file has made use of these.
Sort 3 file has always been for the user to adapt to their liking.

For channels that do not have a proper LCN, they are assigned 65535, you must use the "virtual number".
The virtual number is 65535+EPG ID. So, if you wanted to add BT Sport Mosaic ( EPG ID =5030) into a bouquet, 
the virtual number to use in the sort file would be 70565 (65535+5030). Entry in sort file would be u1=70565

You can now rename the bouquets when using the sort files. The section markers in the large frst bouquet will not be affected.
To do so, you must prefix the bouquet nyumber wih a "$". E.G "$02= Localised channels"

You can also rename Bouquets in the supplement file. This is independent of the sort feature
E.g $01=Entertainment and Lifestyle
